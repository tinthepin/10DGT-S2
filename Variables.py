# Different types of variables 
# Store a number 
num_9 = 11 # assigning 11 to num_9
print(num_9) # This displays what num_9 contains

# Store a string
name = "Titus is weaaaakkk"
print(name)
name = "Sike thats the wrong number" # Reassigning value to an existing variable
print(name)

# Do Calculations in a variable and store the result
sum = 5 + 5 # Leave spaces between sums not like sum=5+5
print(sum)
sum =" 5 + 5 =  "

# Adding strings together is called concatnation
concatenation = name + sum 
print(concatenation)
